          <p>First and foremost, ensure you carry a valid government-issued ID proof such as Aadhaar Card, Voter ID, Driving License, or Passport for domestic travel within India.</p>
          
          <p>For traveling to certain regions like Ladakh, Sikkim, and parts of Northeast India, you may need Inner Line Permits (ILP) or Protected Area Permits (PAP). Apply for these permits well in advance online or through travel agents.</p>
          
          <p>Check the weather conditions of your destination before traveling and pack accordingly. Hill stations require warm clothing even in summer, while coastal areas need light, breathable fabrics.</p>
          
          <p>If traveling to high-altitude destinations like Ladakh, Spiti, or Auli, allow time for acclimatization to prevent altitude sickness. Carry necessary medications and stay hydrated.</p>
          
          <p>Book your train or flight tickets in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons (April-June, September-November) to get better prices and availability.</p>
          
          <p>Get travel insurance that covers trip cancellations, medical emergencies, and loss of belongings. This is especially important for adventure activities like trekking, rafting, or skiing.</p>
          
          <p>For staying connected, BSNL and Airtel generally have better network coverage in remote areas. Download offline maps and important information before reaching areas with limited connectivity.</p>
          
          <p>Carry sufficient cash, especially when traveling to remote areas where ATMs may not be available or card payments aren't accepted. Keep small denominations for local purchases.</p>
          
          <p>Respect local customs and traditions. Dress modestly when visiting religious sites and seek permission before photographing locals or in restricted areas.</p>
          
          <p>Pack a basic first aid kit with essential medicines, band-aids, antiseptic cream, pain relievers, and any personal medications you regularly take.</p>
          
          <p>For adventure activities like trekking, river rafting, or paragliding, choose licensed operators with good safety records. Always wear provided safety gear and follow guide instructions.</p>
          
          <p>Be environmentally responsible. Avoid littering, use reusable water bottles, and follow the 'Leave No Trace' principles, especially in pristine natural areas.</p>
          
          <p>Share your detailed itinerary with family or friends, including accommodation details and contact numbers. Keep emergency contact numbers handy, including local police and tourist helplines.</p>
          
          <p>If traveling during monsoon season (July-September), be prepared for delays and check for landslide warnings, especially in hilly regions. Avoid traveling to flood-prone areas during heavy rains.</p>
          
          <p>Lastly, purchase necessary COVID-19 or other health insurance if required, and follow any health protocols mandated by your destination state or region.</p>
